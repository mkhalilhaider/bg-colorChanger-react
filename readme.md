# üé® BG Color Changer App (React)

This is my **second React app**, a simple background color changer built to practice component-based structure, `useState`, `props`, and event handling in React. Each button changes the background to a specific color when clicked.

## Features
- Dynamically change the background color of the entire screen.
- Each button sets a different color using props.
- Clean component-based architecture.

## Technologies Used
